# youtube-tutorial-bot
A discord.js tutorial-bot made by me!
Source code for the tutorial-bot can be found here.
You need to place your bot's token in the token.json file along with your desired prefix!
this project uses a cmd-handler by [salvage_dev](https://github.com/Milo123459/NewTutorialBot) feel free to check it out!
Make sure to have your details in the config.json before running the bot!
